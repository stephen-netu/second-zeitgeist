title: Second Zeitgeist - A Technology Manifesto
description: A collective vision for technology that serves humanity with integrity and purpose
---

Greetings,

Somehow, in my short time being alive, I believe we are entering into a **second Zeitgeist**—a cultural shift as seismic as the first Zeitgeist I experienced on the morning of **September 11th, 2001**.

Then, we transitioned rapidly into an era of **obedience by design**.  At first, it was about safety, about resilience.  However...what followed—surveillance, censorship, militarized borders, the erosion of civic trust—was something far deeper, and far more permanent.

I was born in 1988.  Since then, I have known nothing but **a world in crisis**.  My nation, that I love so deeply, **perpetually at war**.  Let us recount the entire reckoning:

- **1989** – *Operation Just Cause* in Panama  
- **1990–1991** – *Gulf War*  
- **1992–1995** – *Operation Restore Hope* in Somalia  
- **1994** – *Operation Uphold Democracy* in Haiti  
- **1999** – *Kosovo* bombings via NATO, split congressional vote  
- **2001–2021** – *Afghanistan War* under open-ended AUMF — my stepbrother, friends, and family deployed, some to not return (**thankfully**, my brother did, but forever broken)
- **2003–2011** – *Iraq War*, again without formal declaration  
- **2011** – *Operation Odyssey Dawn* in Libya, executive-led  
- **2014–Present** – Ongoing *Syria airstrikes*, claimed under outdated AUMFs  
- **2015–Present** – Support for Saudi-led war in Yemen, despite humanitarian catastrophe  
- **2010s–Present** – *AFRICOM operations*, drone strikes across the continent, without public awareness  
- **2022–Present** – Billions in military aid and support for Ukraine

These are only the public operations we can actually document (or put online for the general population).  Since WWII, the U.S. has conducted over **100 military operations globally**, the vast majority of them **undeclared** or unauthorized by Congress—in fact, some would contend most if not all were *unconstitutional by design*.

No draft.  No debate.  No accountability.
Yet still—we remain silent—or, at least, we remain *unheard*.

But the most insidious war today?

Is the one **no one names**:

The war on information.  
The war on attention.  
The war on memory.  
**The war of and by AI.**

---

We are building ever-more-powerful AI systems atop a **broken and corrupted substrate**:  
- **Information ecosystems warped by profit** — where surveillance masquerades as convenience. Mark Zuckerberg didn't just build a social network—he studied Mandarin, courted autocracy, and developed an entire platform tailored to feed information directly to the Chinese Communist Party. This wasn't accidental; it was strategic. If our leading technocrats bend the knee so quickly, so willingly—**what hope do we have of regulating the next generation of cognitive empires?**
- **Civic platforms that ignore the invisible** — the destitute, the undocumented, the digitally disconnected. It no longer matters your race, creed, or politics—if you're not monetizable, if you're not loud in the right algorithmic register, then you **simply do not exist**.  The quiet soup kitchen. The grandmother-led food pantry.  The local healer without a Twitter account.  Gone.
- **Interfaces that confuse engagement with meaning** — optimized for consumption, not connection.  "Shop here."  "Buy more."  "Swipe now."  Designed to **keep you spending just enough to stay numb**, but never enough to reach sufficiency.  They are not neutral UX flows—they are **psychological casinos engineered to erode sovereignty.**

If we do not rebuild our **epistemic engines**—those that help people **know**, **decide**, and **act together**—we won't just lose truth.

We will lose the *capacity for collective coherence*.  **We will have no ontological metanarrative whatsoever.**

Therefore, I've spent my career building or chasing **counter-systems**.

Tools that turn complexity into clarity.
Chaos into coordination.
Automation into **alignment with human dignity**.

I've built or had the esteemed privilege of working at building:
- **Unusual Whales** — The true democratization of stock market information; the counter to the Bloomberg terminal
- **FLOW / KOS / Principus** — A testable governance and reasoning layer for intelligent agents navigating contradiction, shifting trust, and epistemic thresholds
- **Civic Atlas** — A decentralized civic discovery engine designed to map hidden local opportunity and lift the quiet voices ignored by SEO and adtech
- **Markets News** & **CardByMe** — LLM-powered platforms fighting financial disinformation and reviving human presence through postal tech

All rooted in the belief that **technology must restore balance**.  
Not just ease burdens—but **return sovereignty**, **enhance agency**, and **reweave meaning**.

---

We do not need more charters.  
We need **counter-infrastructure**.

- Systems that **flag contradiction**, not smooth it over  
- Agents that say, "This idea doesn't align with your goals—pause?"  
- Architectures that encode **ontological repair**, not just data pipelining

Most "ethical AI" efforts stop at conversation.  
I believe we must go further—into **confrontation, capacity, and care**.

**Not just better intentions, but better *ops*.**  
Not just slower collapse, but **tools that can resist empire**.

Because the world we are inheriting is not neutral.  
It is tilted toward noise, dislocation, and erasure.

And I, for one, do not consent.

---

These are the wars I fight:  
- A war against institutionalized amnesia
- A war for systems that serve communities—not empire
- A war to restore truth—not as fact alone, but as navigable coherence

This is what I stand for.
This is what I build.
**This is the future I seek allies for.**

With conviction and clarity,
